### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Aszalea! Like As-You-Lay. It's nice to meet you!      

<br> 
I am a Full-Stack Web Developer, UX Designer and Illustrator. I am attending two programs to further my education: Lambda School and CareerFoundry. Each is helping me gain vital knowdge to work towards my goal of becoming a Product Manager. Lambda, which is a full stack web development and computer science course, has helped me get an in depth look into how to code production ready applications. CareerFoundry, which is a User design mastery course, has helped me look into human physcology and build with people in mind.

ðŸŒ± I have had a wonderful time learning coding and ux. In the limited amount of spare time I have I love to read, play video games, and design logos.

ðŸ˜„ I love learning new languages. Along side these listed ones, I have been working towards learning Japanese. Slowly I am learning more and more!
