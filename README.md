I'm Aszalea (like As-you-lay), an AI Product Designer specializing in human-AI interfaces for the global innovative tech ecosystem. My approach combines data-driven insights, human-centered design human oversight, and regulatory compliance for business strategy to deliver solutions that stand out in today's competitive tech landscape.

With 4+ years experience redesigning legacy systems and developing new AI-driven products at MRI-Simmons (GfK), I've tackled complex challenges that others avoided. My proudest achievements include overhauling data visualization tools, scaling enterprise-level datasets, and developing natural language AI interfaces that democratize data insightsâ€”skills particularly valuable in AI, Market Research and ad Tech sectors.

My professional journey began at a social good coffee roaster before transitioning to UX, Product Design, and Product Management. This diverse background enables me to bridge technical capabilities with meaningful user experiencesâ€”a combination increasingly sought after by global most forward-thinking tech companies.

I excel at:
â€¢ Translating complex requirements into simplified design specifications
â€¢ Managing global teams across disciplines
â€¢ Collaborating with engineers and data scientists
â€¢ Creating intuitive interfaces for data-heavy applications

My credentials include certifications in Google AI Essentials, Market Research methodologies, and UX Design. I'm currently pursuing advanced Machine Learning certification through Stanford to further enhance my AI product design capabilities.

As the global tech scene continues expanding its focus on ethical AI and user-centered applications, I'm eager to contribute my expertise to teams building next-generation intelligence tools that solve real human problems.

Let's connect and explore how we might collaborate in shaping the AI landscape!
